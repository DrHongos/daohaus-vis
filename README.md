### How to use Tailwind + Chakra UI

Chakra UI borrows a lot of concepts from Tailwind and you will find their API very similar. However, after using chakra for few hours, I realised the layout features are not as rich as I thought and I had to install tailwind.

1. Use Tailwind CSS for layout and typography, avoid Chakra UI components + Typography
2. Use Chakra UI for all other components i.e. Forms, Data Display, Feedback, Overlay, Disclosure, Media and Icons.
3. In case you have a custom need, you might want to explore headless-ui/react package and build your UI.
4. Feel free to add Tailwind plugins, but make sure they dont conflict with Chakra UI
